# Payments Data Frontend
This is a frontend for an interview problem. 

## User Interface
There is a dashboard page containing a payment data list, filter options, a payment data creation button.

### Payment Data List
The payment data list contains id, date, sender user name, receiver user name, amount, currency, memo. These all values are in the get api response from the server. The payment data list is updated every seconds from the server. 

### Filter Options
The user can filter by filter options.
The filter options includes id, date, sender, receiver, min amount, max amount, currency, memo.

### Payment data Creation
The user can create a payment data on the payment data creation form that appears when clicking the "Create a Payment Data" button.
The user can select sender and receiver, currency and also input amount and memo.
When clicking the create button, a new payment method is created and the user can see it is on the top of the payment data list
